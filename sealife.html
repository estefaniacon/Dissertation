  <h1>Could there be plastic in the seafood you consume?</h1>
  <b>Goverment's scientific report shows that plastic pieces are the second most found litter items in the ocean and sealife is ingesting it.</b>

  <p>Plastic waste not only ends up in the ocean but it might also end up in the organism of fish and other sea life that ingest particles of this material, which may lead to people consuming contaminated food. This is an alarming fact that is of interest to anyone that consumes products from the ocean.</br></br>

  It is estimated that 150 million tonnes of plastic have reached the worlds oceans and 100,000 marine mammals died for ingesting or getting injured with plastic, according to The Guardian.</br></br>

  These alarming figures, that are of public interest and a global issue, has been addressed by every major environmental NGO in the UK and the world like the WWF and Greenpeace.</br></br>

  Conforming to the European Environment Agency, solid materials, typically waste that has found its way to the marine environment is called marine debris. This is known to be the cause of injuries and deaths of numerous marine animals and birds, either because they become entangled in it or they mistake it for prey and eat it.</br></br>

  At least 267 different species are known to have suffered from entanglement or ingestion of marine debris including seabirds, turtles, seals, sea lions, whales and fish.</br></br>

  Laura Parker, from National Geographic Magazine, wrote that there’s little evidence yet that micro plastics, tiny bits of plastic disintegrated from waste, can end up in the flesh we eat from a fish, but Nano plastics, smaller particles that come from micro plastics, might pass into the tissues of fish and humans.</br></br>

  “Experts have found micro plastics in 114 aquatic species, and more than half of those end up in our dinner plates. Now they are trying to determine what that means to human heath.”, she said in the august 2018 issue.</br></br>

  This article claims that our food supply doesn’t seem to be under threat according to the information they have but that sea creatures like fish and shellfish that we eat are in fact affected my plastic waste.</br></br>

  In the report <a href = "https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/634433/Future_of_the_sea_-_plastic_pollution_final.pdf">Future of the Sea: Plastic Pollution</a>, published by the Government Office for Science, Doctor Richard Thompson states that 70% of the debris in the oceans is made of plastic and that these items are used for a human benefit that is completely unnecessary.</br></br>

  “Plastic pollution can be harmful to wildlife, human well-being and to the economy in the UK, its Overseas Territories (OTs) and internationally. There is extensive evidence that entanglement in, or ingestion of, plastics can cause injury and death to a wide range of marine organisms, including commercially important fish and shellfish,” claimed Thompson.</br></br>

  According to this report, over 700 species of marine organism, like mammals, birds, fish and invertebrates, are known be around plastic waste. Most animals that encounter plastic debris end up injured, dead, or have other effects on how the behave and they way they survive. Their ability to feed, escape from predators or migrate can be severely affected.</br></br>

  Around 250 species have been entangled in plastic. This includes over 50 species of marine mammals, over 100 species of sea birds, many species of fish and all seven species of marine turtles.</br></br>

  In the UK surveys indicate the incidence of entanglement ranges 15 Review of Evidence: Plastic Pollution between 2–9 per cent for some populations of seabirds and marine mammals</br></br>

  Around 300 species are known to ingest plastic litter in the environment. These range from small planktonic and benthic invertebrates to fish, birds and mammals.</br></br>

  Despite the lack of proof of the harm that plastic particles inside seafood can cause to humans, Thompson confirmed that ingestion is widely reported and is particularly common for small fragments of debris, including a wide range of common post-consumer items such as bottle caps, balloons and sewage-related debris.</br></br>

  The European Environment Agency created The Marine Litter Watch, composed by citizens that took part in cleanup activities on 1627 beaches of Europe’s four regional seas (the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the North-East Atlantic Ocean) between 2014 and 2017.</br></br>


  In 2015, 42 different categories of waste were found on the beach. They were composed of different materials like clothes, glass, metal, rubber and plastic. The data, published by the European Environment Topics Agency, shows that 31 distinct plastic items, these accounts to 74% of the different materials found in the ocean, were made of plastic. Things like lolly sticks, cutlery, cigarette lighters and even sandals were found that year.</br></br>

  The same information throws that from the overall marine debris and from all the different items found, 91% were plastic objects. The number one marine litter items found are plastic pieces with sizes ranging from 2.5 to 50 centimeters. These pieces are an example of how micro and nanoplastics can start to break into smaller pieces overtime and can be ingested by sea life. This means these plastic pieces and also polystyrene piece, which came in second place, are equal to 22% of all the trash found on the beach that year. Cigarette buts and filters are the third most found item near the ocean, followed by different types of drink plastic bottles in fourth and fifth place.</br></br>

  The dataset shows that straws and stirrers, items that have been hugely mediatic and are the target of many ecological campaigns around the world, rank 21st as most found marine debris, far bellow waste like crisp packets, shopping bags and even items with a different material, like metal cans. Straws only compose 1.2 % of the all the waste found in the beaches.</br></br></br>

  <Image src= "Vis/Litter_items_graph.png"></br></br>



  Another dataset from the Marine Litter Watch, composed of information collected from 2014 to 2017, reveals that cigarette buts and filters is the number one item found on European beaches in these last years. These items are equal to almost 17% of the marine debris found. The second most found plastic items in all those years are pieces of plastic with different sizes.</br></br>

  Plastic was again the most found material contaminating the oceans with more than 80% of the marine debris made out of this component. Ceramic and glass is the second most found material with over 5% and metal the third one with almost 4% of all the waste.</br></br>

  The least found items were cartons and tetra pack milk containers, plastic pens sanitary towels and construction materials, among others. The most found items not made of plastic were glass or ceramic fragments, taking almost 4% of the overall collected waste.</br></br>

  Single use plastic items that humans buy everyday of the year are covering the oceans and beaches around Europe. Since 2014, plastics caps are the fifth most found item, followed by shopping bags, strings/cords, packets of crisps and sweets and cotton buds sticks, consecutively.</br></br>

  Again, the data shows that a plastic item that has draw a lot of attention to the public eye is only a tiny percentage of the overall litter observed. Straws and stirrers make up only 2% of the marine debris in the oceans. While eliminating the use of these items could help reduce plastic waste, it is important to mention that there are other objects like the cigarette filters that are equal to 7 times that amount.</br></br>

  The United Kingdom is 5th highest country in the European Union for consumption of single use plastic products. The UK consumes more cotton buds and sanitary towels than any other member of the EU, and has the second highest consumption for 7 other items, according to a report published by the WWF.</br></br>

  Between 2005 and 2014 volunteers took part in 3,245 beach cleans and they discovered that plastics compose 80% of the trash on UK shores, most of it packaging, and that most of this waste came from land-based sources.</br></br>

  “The majority of this litter originates from the land with rivers providing an important pathway to the sea. To reduce it, a key priority is to focus on interventions and stewardship to help reduce the quantity of plastic waste generated by society and the associated release of litter to the ocean.” said Thompson.</br></br>

  South-west Britain had higher levels of marine debris contamination probably because of the big cities like Swansea, Newport, Bristol and Plymouth together with rivers facilitating discharge, tourism, busy shipping routes and wind-driven litter from the Atlantic, states the report Future of the Sea.</br></br>

  The amount of marine debris found in the worlds oceans keep rising every single day due to the ongoing production of plastic and the consumption of these material to package food and water and to carry things. In the beginning, plastic was discovered to be a resistant and handy material that could contain all sorts of solid and liquid products for human consumption, but nowadays the amount of waste is uncontainable. Plastic items are mostly used only one time and are then thrown away sometimes that same day and end up in landfill and oceans for years with no purpose.</p></br></br>
