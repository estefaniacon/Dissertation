    <h2>Supermarkets sign pact to recycle but keep plastic and sell pricier items</h2>
    <b>Biggest supermarkets in the UK sign public pact to tackle
      plastic pollution but NGOs say it’s not enough.</b><br><br>

        <p>Some supermarkets in the UK like Tesco Metro, Lidl, Sainsbury’s and
          many more don’t offer plastic free options to sell products like fresh
          vegetables and fruit. Most of these perishable items come wrapped in
          plastic, inside a plastic bag or in a plastic try and some of them even
          come in a plastic tray inside a plastic bag.<br><br>
          When you enter a food shop in the UK you can see everything is
          pretty much plastic and when consumers shop in the fruits and
          vegetables section it can be easy for them to choose what already comes
          inside a package and has a price tag on. Some of these items are
          marked as premium or organic and the vast majority of them carry the
          supermarket’s brand. <br><br>
          Some products packaged with plastic are more expensive than loose
          vegetables and fruits, but the way they are branded and priced can
          make it look like they are cheaper.</br></br>
          For example, a customer can look at the options of broccoli in a
          Marks & Spencer and see one broccoli wrapped in plastic with a 1 pound
          sticker on it and at first, it looks like the plastic-free option, the
          loose broccoli, has a price of 1.35 pounds. That person could assume
          that the plastic one is 35 pence cheaper and put it in the trolley,
          but the loose broccoli is actually 1.35 per kilogram. You can actually
          buy double the amount of product, 2 broccoli, for the same price if
          you buy it lose.<br></br><br>

            What a person chooses to buy when they go to a supermarket is part
            of the throwaway culture that exists in the UK and all over the world.
            People are used to buying items like vegetables, fish, yogurt, bread
            or any other normal grocery product inside a plastic package, it seems
            more convenient and easier to grab.<br></br>
            Picking loose items instead of plastic would reduce dramatically the
            amount of waste generated in a household and maybe even push
            foodshop chains to decrease their production of plastic and also create
            plastic free aisles.<br></br>

            Besides the benefits that reducing plastic pollution would to the
            environment, purchasing plastic free could be more budget friendly.
            Depending on the item and the shop, it might be cheaper to get your
            fruits and vegetables loose. However, not every company has loose or
            plastic free options for every fresh item they offer, most of them
            leave the customer with the only choice of buying with plastic or
            going to another shop.<br></br>

            Even though this big food shop chains like Marks & Spencer, Tesco,
            Lidl, Sainsbury’s and others, signed up to be part of <a href=
            "http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/the-uk-plastics-pact">The UK Plastic
            Pact</a>, they still offer an enormous amount of their products
            wrapped or packed in plastic every single day and it does not seem
            like they have reduced the use of plastic.<br></br>

            Supermarkets in the UK produce 800,000 tonnes of plastic packaging
            in a year. Even if it reused or recycled most of this waste ends up
            incinrated on landfill as litter or even in rivers and oceans,
            according to Greenpeace UK.<br></br>
            Back in April The UK Plastic Pact was announced. It is a movement
            that has the biggest supermarkets in the country and other big
            companies like Coca-Cola and Danone pledging to reduce and redesign
            plastic packaging. <br></br>
            “No one business, council, recycle or government department can
            create a New Plastic Economy alone. Only a common approach to polymer
            use, recovery and reuse will deliver the change we need. At M&S, we
            will play our part and are committed to reducing our plastic use and
            making all our packaging widely recyclable. “ stated Mike Barry,
            Director of Plan A at Marks & Spencer.<br></br>

            This agreement, organized by the charity WRAP, is looking to create
            a circular economy for plastic; however, Non-governmental
            organizations and experts say that is not enough to tackle the
            problem.<br></br>

            The pact has a goal of making 100% of all plastic packaging
            reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025 but Alice Hunter, a
            Digital campaigner at Greenpeace UK, stated bioplastics can be just as
            bad as normal plastic, they can end up in the ocean and endanger sea
            life and recycling is just not sufficient at this point.<br></br>
            “Recycling is absolutely vital for dealing with waste, and we
            definitely shouldn’t start chucking everything in the bin for
            landfill. But unfortunately, our recycling systems just can’t cope
            with the amount of plastic we currently produce – especially as
            plastic production is on the increase.”, claimed Hunter.<br></br>
            Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Co-op, Aldi, Waitrose, Lidl, Asda, Morrison and
            Marks & Spencer produce tonnes of plastic packaging every year and
            they are not doing enough to prevent plastic waste ending in the
            ocean. <br></br>
            Some claim that plastic is useful to avoid the product from bruising
            or to even reduce food waste but according to Greenpeace UK, a study
            has shown that it could make it worse.<br></br>
            “When plastic packaging requires food to be a specific size or
            shape, edible food is rejected because it does not look the right way”,
            said the NGO.<br></br>
            Some of these companies announced that are making changes and that
            are committed to reducing specific plastic products but according to
            Hunter, supermarkets make small tweaks that are just enough to make
            them look good, but not enough to significantly reduce their plastic
            pollution.<br></br>
            “Supermarkets need to acknowledge the need to reduce the amount of
            plastic packaging on their shelves, and urgently commit to plastic
            reduction targets.”, said the Greenpeace campaigner.<br></br>
            WRAP has stated they will not publicly address or shame the
            organizations that do not comply with this pact, which leaves this
            voluntary initiative with no enforcement mechanism. This pact also
            fails to commit to removing all single-use packaging, instead
            promising to remove “problematic or unnecessary” single-use plastic by 2025.<br></br>
  A report by the World Wild Fund for Nature shows that 67% of plastic
waste in the UK actually comes from packaging and 70% of this
packaging market comes from the grocery sector.<br></br>
  The real solution to reduce the 10 million tonnes of packaging used
in the UK every year, more than using bio-plastics, compostable or
recyclable products, is that food shops stop using plastic
altogether.<br></br>
“Sometimes packaging is necessary – pre-chopped fruit and veg are
vital for people who have accessibility issues. Stopping excess
plastic at the source will mean that there’s less of it in circulation
and ultimately less plastic in our oceans.<br></br>
  There is no evidence that these companies are reducing or completely
banning plastic packaging in comparison to other companies like
Iceland and Ekoplaza, which have introduced plastic-free
aisles.<br></br>
  Co-founder of the organization A Plastic Planet, Sian Sutherland,
has created this initiative of plastic free aisles and empowers the
consumer to shop consciously and go plastic free. <br></br>
  “Recent history has proven that recycling this kind of plastic is
not the answer; it is valueless, too difficult to reclaim and often
contaminated. It’s fundamentally the wrong use of plastic in the first
place. But right now the public has no choice but to buy their food
and drink packaged in this indestructible plastic.” claims the
organization on their website.<br></br>
  Globally, the largest market for plastic is packaging. Most of this
waste never gets recycled or incinerated and represents half of all
the plastic waste in the world, according to National Geographic
Magazine.<br></br>
